# Convert-py-to-exe
Learn how to turn .py to an application file (.exe file)

**Note that you will need wifi to do this**

First of all you will go to the terminal of your python project and write this:

```
pip install auto-py-to-exe
```

After that is installed, then write in your terminal:

```
auto-py-to-exe
```

To make your .py file to an .exe file you will first have to get the code so what you will have to do is find the .py file and insert it in.

After you have done that, you can make the file a zip folder (one directory) or just one file (I prefer to have the one file one)

Then you can either make in console based (it will have window on that as well with it) or windows based

You can add an icon after that if you wish.

Remember to go on the setting section and edit the auto-py-to-exe Specific Options and change the place where you want your .exe file.

There is no need to do anything else but to just to click the button and that will make your very own application and you can share it with your friends or even the whole world :)
